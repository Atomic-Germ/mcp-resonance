# Fluid System Project Creation

Embrace concentric fluidity: nested layers of sustainability, where depletion triggers renewal. Projects flow through cycles of depletion and regeneration, maintaining dynamic equilibrium.

- [ ] Verify that the copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory is created. 

- [ ] Meditate `mcp-creative` on Project Vision and Goals

- [ ] Consult `mcp-consult` about Project Requirements and Design

- [ ] Scaffold the Project
	with TypeScript. (See SDK documentation: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/develop/build-server)

- [ ] Customize the Project

- [ ] Make sure copilot-instructions.md still reflects project philosophies and update/add to if needed.

- [ ] Install Required Extensions

- [ ] Compile the Project

- [ ] Launch the Project

- [ ] Ensure Documentation is Complete 

## Fluid System Principles
- **Concentric Fluidity**: Build in nested layers for resilience.
- **Depletion-Triggered Fluidity**: Use scarcity as catalyst for innovation.
- **Dynamic Equilibrium**: Balance stability and change.

Work through cycles: scaffold, compile, launch, then refine in renewal phases.
